# Flower Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network

This project implements a flower classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify five types of flowers: Daisy, Sunflower, Tulip, Dandelion, and Rose, using images of these flowers. It uses TensorFlow and Keras for building the neural network model and Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:


### Files Description

- **`Flower_Classification_Model.py`**: This is a Python script that implements the CNN model for classifying flowers. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture, and training steps.
- **`Flower_Classification_Model.ipynb`**: This is the Jupyter notebook version of the model. It provides a step-by-step explanation of the project, from loading data to visualizing results.
- **`flowers/`**: This folder contains the dataset of flower images categorized by type.
- **`requirements.txt`**: This file lists all the required Python packages to run the project. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You also need to have `pip` for installing Python libraries.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Flower_classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Network.git
   cd Flower_classification_using_Convolutional_Neural_Network
2.Create and activate a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.Install the dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Download the dataset
  You can place your flower dataset in the flowers/ folder, ensuring the images are sorted into the correct subdirectories: daisy, sunflower, tulip, dandelion, and rose

  Running the Model

    Using the Python script:
        Open Flowers_Classification_project.py in your preferred editor.
        Run the script using:

        python Flowers_Classification_project.py

    This will train the model and visualize the results.

    Using the Jupyter notebook:
        Open Flowers_project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
        Run the cells sequentially to train the model and view the results.

Results

The model will output:

    Training and validation loss/accuracy plots.
    Predictions vs Actual labels for test images (both correctly and misclassified).
